Links included in payload of responses SHOULD also be included as `Link` headers in the HTTP response according to <<rfc8288,RFC 8288, Clause 3>>.

This recommendation does not apply, if there are a large number of links included in a response or a link is not known when the HTTP headers of the response are created.
