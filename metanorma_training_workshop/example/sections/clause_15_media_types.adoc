== Media Types

JSON media types that would typically be used in a server that supports JSON are:

* `application/json` for all resources.

The typical HTML media type for all "web pages" in a server would be:

* `text/html`.

The media type for an OpenAPI 3.0 definition is
`application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0` (JSON) or
`application/vnd.oai.openapi;version=3.0` (YAML).

NOTE: The OpenAPI media types have not been registered yet with IANA and can
change in the future.
