== Requirements Class "OGC Process Description"

The following section describes the `OGC Process Description` requirements
class.


=== Overview

include::../requirements/requirements_class_ogc-process-description.adoc[]

The OGC process description is an information model that may be used to specify the interface of a process.  This model is an evolution of the process description model originally defined in the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-065/14-065.html[OGC WPS 2.0.2 Interface Standard] but also includes elements of the http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3[OpenAPI Specification].  Specifically, this process description languages uses https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema] fragments to define the input and output parameters of a process.  As such, this process description provides a bridge from legacy implementations to the OGC API Framework.

The process description allows the following information to be specified:

* An identifier for the process
* Descriptive metadata about the process;
** A title
** A narrative description of the process
** Keywords that can be associated with the process
** References to additional metadata
* A description of each process input specified using a https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema] fragment.
* A description of each process output specified using a https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema] fragment.
* A job control specification that indicates whether the process can be invoked synchronously, asynchronously, or either.
* An output transmission specification that indicates how the results of a process are retrieved; either by value or by reference
* A section for additional parameters that are intended for communities of use to extend the process description as required

The following clause defines a JSON-encoding of the OGC process description.


=== OGC process description

.Schema for a process
[source,yaml]
----
include::../openapi/schemas/process.yaml[]
----

NOTE: This schema can also be obtained from http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/processes/part1/1.0/openapi/schemas/process.yaml[`process.yaml`]

(see also: <<schema-processSummary,`processSummary.yaml`>>)

The schema imports the elements from the <<schema-processSummary, process summary>> and specifies an object for the definition of process inputs and another object for the definition of process outputs.

include::../requirements/ogc-process-description/REQ_inputs-def.adoc[]

.Schema for a process input
[source,yaml]
----
include::../openapi/schemas/inputDescription.yaml[]

NOTE: This schema can also be obtained from http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/processes/part1/1.0/openapi/schemas/inputDescription.yaml[`inputDescription.yaml`]

(see also: http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/processes/part1/1.0/openapi/schemas/descriptionType.yaml[`descriptionType.yaml`]).

include::../requirements/ogc-process-description/REQ_input-def.adoc[]

NOTE: The schema fragment specified as the value of the `schema` parameter can be used to validate the corresponding <<input-value-schema,process input value>> in an <<execute-request-body,execute request>>.

include::../requirements/ogc-process-description/REQ_input-binary.adoc[]

include::../requirements/ogc-process-description/REQ_input-mixed-type.adoc[]

The following JSON Schema fragment illustrates how to define an input of mixed type.  In this case, the `imageInput` input can be one of a couple of image media types.

include::../recommendations/ogc-process-description/REC_format-key.adoc[]

The <<jsonschemavalidation,JSON Schema specification>> defines a https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.7[set of values] for the `format` key.  This specification extends this list by defining the following additional key values for use specifically in OGC process descriptions.

The following JSON Schema fragment illustrates the use of the `format` key to include a semantic hint to a process input that is a geometry.
