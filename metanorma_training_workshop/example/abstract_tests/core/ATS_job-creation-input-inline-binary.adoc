[.component,class=step]
--
Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that have binary inputs.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> taking care to encode binary input values in-line in the execute request according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-input-inline-binary,/req/core/job-creation-input-inline-binary>>.
--
