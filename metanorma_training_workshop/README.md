## Metanorma for OGC - Training

### Pre-requisite

Install docker, if you have not already done so. Instructions are at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Docker is a containerization software product that reserves and isolates resources on a host machine for use by an application.

Several applications, including metanorma, can be pulled in from Docker Hub â€“ an online registry of docker images

Once docker is installed, you are ready to run metanorma.

More information about installing metanorma can be found at https://www.metanorma.org/install/
