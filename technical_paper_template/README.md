# Technical Paper template

This GitHub repository contains the content for an OGC Technical Paper (formerly White Paper).

The repo is organized as follows:

* index.adoc - nothing in this document
* technical_paper - the main Technical Paper document content
  - organized in multiple sections and directories
  - this is the only part needed to create a Technical Paper document
  - Technical Papers have no set structure, so organize the content as best fits your purposes
